<p>It was my birthday <strong>again</strong> last week and I was gifted an Amazon gift card and on a whim I bought <a href="https://amzn.to/2PaNZeY">this watch</a> for about $15.00, so as can be exepected I did not have high hopes. But, I was pleasantly surpised and it alerts me of my notifications and calls as well as count steps.</p>
<p>A pretty good deal for $15.00</p>
